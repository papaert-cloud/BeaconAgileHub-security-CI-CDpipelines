**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Deciders**: DevSecOps Team, Security Team, Platform Team

### Context
Need to coordinate multiple complex workflows (security, infrastructure, deployment, testing, monitoring, compliance) in a scalable, maintainable way while ensuring proper dependency management and error handling.

### Decision
Implement a master orchestration workflow that acts as a control plane, coordinating specialized sub-workflows through reusable workflow calls with proper input/output contracts.

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each workflow focuses on a specific domain
- **Reusability**: Sub-workflows can be called from multiple contexts
- **Maintainability**: Changes to specific domains don't affect the entire pipeline
- **Scalability**: Parallel execution where dependencies allow
- **Observability**: Clear workflow boundaries for monitoring and debugging

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear separation, better maintainability, parallel execution
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in workflow orchestration, more files to manage
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and standardized patterns

**Deciders**: QA Team, DevSecOps Team, Security Team

### Context
Enterprise applications require multiple testing layers: unit, integration, contract, E2E, performance, security, and chaos engineering.

### Decision
Implement a comprehensive testing orchestration that runs appropriate test suites based on environment and deployment strategy, with parallel execution where possible.

### Rationale
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple test layers catch different issue types
- **Performance Validation**: Load testing ensures scalability

**Deciders**: Operations Team, DevSecOps Team, Business Team

### Context
Enterprise systems require monitoring across multiple dimensions: infrastructure, application, security, cost, and business metrics with appropriate alerting.

### Decision
Implement multi-dimensional monitoring orchestration that deploys appropriate monitoring stack based on environment, with integrated alerting and SLA/SLO tracking.

### Rationale
- **Observability**: Comprehensive visibility across all system layers
- **Proactive Management**: Early warning through appropriate alerting
- **Cost Control**: Automated cost monitoring and anomaly detection
- **Business Alignment**: SLA/SLO tracking tied to business objectives
- **Security Monitoring**: Integrated security event monitoring

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Comprehensive observability, proactive issue detection
- **Negative**: Complex monitoring setup, potential alert fatigue
- **Mitigation**: Intelligent alerting, environment-appropriate monitoring levels
