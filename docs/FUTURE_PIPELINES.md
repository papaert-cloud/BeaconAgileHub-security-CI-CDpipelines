## ⚡ Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) Integration

### **EDA Architecture**

Event-Driven Ansible provides the critical bridge between N8N's orchestration capabilities and Ansible's configuration management through YAML rulebooks that connect event sources to conditional rules triggering playbook execution.

**Core Components**:
1. **Event Sources**: Webhooks, Kafka, Alertmanager, CloudWatch Events
2. **Rulebooks**: YAML-defined conditional logic for event processing
3. **Actions**: Ansible playbook execution based on rule matches
4. **State Management**: Persistent event state and decision tracking
