## Vulnerability Management Framework

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) Handling

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Vulnerability Detected] --> B[CVSS Score Assessment]
    B --> C{Severity Level}
    C -->|Critical/High| D[Block Deployment]
    C -->|Medium| E[Create Issue]
    C -->|Low/Info| F[Log for Review]
    D --> G[Security Team Alert]
    E --> H[Schedule Remediation]
    F --> I[Regular Review Cycle]
```

### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) Implementation

| CVSS Score | Severity | Action | Timeline |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical | Block deployment, immediate fix | 24 hours |
| 7.0 - 8.9  | High     | Block deployment, urgent fix | 72 hours |
| 4.0 - 6.9  | Medium   | Allow with tracking | 30 days |
| 0.1 - 3.9  | Low      | Log and monitor | Next release cycle |

### Vulnerability Disclosure Workflow

1. **Detection**: Automated scanning identifies vulnerability
2. **Assessment**: CVSS scoring and impact analysis
3. **Notification**: Security team and stakeholders alerted
4. **Remediation**: Patch development and testing
5. **Deployment**: Secure rollout of fixes
6. **Verification**: Post-deployment security validation
7. **Documentation**: Lessons learned and process improvement

## Compliance Evidence Collection

### Automated Evidence Generation

Our pipeline automatically generates compliance evidence:

```bash
# SBOM Evidence
syft . -o cyclonedx-json=sbom.json

# Vulnerability Scan Evidence  
grype sbom:sbom.json -o json --file vulnerability-report.json

# Provenance Evidence
cosign verify-attestation --type slsaprovenance IMAGE_URI

# Security Policy Evidence
kubectl get clusterpolicy -o yaml > security-policies.yaml
```

### Evidence Storage

All compliance evidence is stored in S3 with the following structure:

```
s3://security-artifacts-bucket/
â”œâ”€â”€ sboms/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ {commit-sha}/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ sbom-cyclonedx.json
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ sbom-spdx.json
â”œâ”€â”€ scans/
